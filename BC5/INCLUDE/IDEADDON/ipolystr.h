	IPolyString interface

	PolyString's represent a string that once set, never changes in content
	during its lifetime. Conversions are provided on demand between 'C'  
	and BSTR style strings. 
   
	Conversions of a particular string are never performed more than once, 
	since they are kept in memory until the PolyString is released by all 
	clients.

	If a function returns a PolyString, the caller of the function is responsible
	for releasing the PolyString when finished with it.

	If you are passing a PolyString as an argument to a function, the receiver
	of the PolyString is responsible for Releasing it sometime after receiving
	it. 

	If you return a PolyString from your function or pass a PolyString to a 
	function and aren't finished with the string, remember to bump up the 
	reference count and release it when you are finished with it.
   
   
   Note: Originally, 32-bit Delphi string support was planned, but this turned
   out to be undesirable, since those strings are memory managed and ref-counted
   by the Delphi shared memory manager. It is also a trivial matter to do the 
   conversion to a 'C' string and back in Delphi. We didn't realize this until 
   after the IPolyString interface was frozen, so the GetPstr()/SetPstr() 
   methods are defined, but they have no effect.
