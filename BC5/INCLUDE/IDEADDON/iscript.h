	ScriptServer Interface 
   Using this interface you can install scripts, call functions written in
   script (yours or the ide's) and have access to the ide's scriptable
   class objects.

// 
// Warning! Do not attempt to issue any script commands in anything but the 
// main UI thread. Currently, the addon wrapper dll does not protect you from
// doing this, but script methods will generally leave the IDE in a 
// crippled state when run from another thread. 
// 
// The most common place that  you would be tempted to do this is if you have
// installed a translator tool that has registered an IToolImplementor 
// interface. If the user has put the IDE in async mode, your 
// IToolImplementor::Execute() method will be called in a seperate make thread.
// Do not try to call through the IScriptServer from within this thread. 
// 
// Note regarding all 'scriptName' arguments: Scripts, by convention have
// the extension .spp and are compiled into token files with the extension
// .spx. When calling the RunScriptFile, ScheduleScriptFile or UnloadScriptFile
//  methods, omitting the extension will cause the script engine to only 
// re-compile the .spp if the .spx is missing or out-of-date with regards to
// its .spp counterpart. However, if you add the .spp extension, the file will
// always be re-compiled, which is usually undesirable on account of the time
// involved. If you need to call UnloadScriptFile, use the same name string you 
// used to Run or Schedule it.
